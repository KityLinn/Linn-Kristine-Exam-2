In this project I was tasked with creating an online booking site using a provided API. It allows users to view a list of venues as well as individual venues, search through venues, create a new venue and edit one. It is a primarily react based application using a series of dependencies listed below. Boostrap, scss



It contains:

- Login page
- Register page
- Venues page
- Single venue page
- New venue page
- Edit venue page
- profile page

## Description

The booking site is aimed at a general audience of adults, it has a professional looking and simple design allowing for easy navigation. It lets the user register an account through the API, register as either a venue manager or not, then login and place fictional bookings as well as create fictional venues.
